"""scan_with_health.py — `aios-ingest scan` with `metrics.codebase_health` attached (AIO-608).

Used by the health-enrichment path of .github/workflows/scan-on-merge.yml whenever Brain
credentials are configured and a non-empty contract-shaped health JSON was produced. It
reuses the ingestion sidecar's own analyzer + client from the pinned Team Brain checkout so
the brain receives the
SAME full-metrics payload `aios-ingest scan` would send, plus the contract-shaped
`codebase_health` object produced by scripts/codebase-health/push-payload.mjs. A sparse
health-only payload is never sent — the brain 422s it and the metrics upsert REPLACES the
(codebase_id, head_sha) row, so health must always ride on the full block.

Health is opt-in ENRICHMENT, never a gate: if the health file is unreadable, off-contract,
or describes a different head, the attachment is skipped with a warning and the base scan
is pushed anyway — base telemetry must never be lost to a health problem.

The scheduled patrol passes --expected-head-sha. In that mode health becomes fail-closed: the
health object, analyzer checkout, and pre-resolved default-branch head must all agree before any
upload. This leaves the historical scan-on-merge behavior backward-compatible.

Auth is identical to `aios-ingest scan`: BrainSettings.from_env() (BRAIN_URL / AIOS_API_KEY /
AIOS_TEAM) + optional GITHUB_TOKEN for enrichment. No new credentials, no flags for secrets.
