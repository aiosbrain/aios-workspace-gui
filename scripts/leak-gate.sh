# leak-gate.sh — confidentiality leak gate for the AIOS workspace toolkit.
#
# Scans the tree for any confidential identifier that must never appear in this
# open-source repository: client/firm names, person names, venture/product
# codenames, and business-data patterns. A clean run returns ZERO matches.
#
# IMPORTANT (public-repo design): the confidential term set is NOT stored in this
# repo — that would itself enumerate the protected identifiers. Terms load from a
# local, untracked file so the open-source tree never carries them:
#   1. $AIOS_LEAK_TERMS_FILE                  (explicit path), else
#   2. ~/.config/aios-nda/leak-gate-terms.sh  (default local install), else
#   3. $AIOS_LEAK_TERMS_B64                    (base64 of the same file — for CI via a repo secret)
# The terms file is shell-sourceable and defines three vars: STRONG, WORDS, PATTERNS
# (each a grep -E alternation).
#
# If no term set is configured, the gate still enforces baseline shape rules, then reports
# SKIPPED with exit 0 to distinguish that reduced coverage from a full term-set pass.
#
# ── OUTPUT CONTAINMENT: the gate must not become the leak ────────────────────
# This gate used to print the matching `grep -n` lines. That wrote the very identifier it
# exists to contain into terminal scrollback AND — because scripts/build.mjs,
# scripts/promote.mjs and scripts/timeline.mjs each CAPTURE this script's stdout+stderr and
# re-emit it into findings / review context — into downstream artifacts, and into the CI job
# log whenever $AIOS_LEAK_TERMS_B64 is set. A CI log is usually readable by more people than
# the repository the gate is protecting.
#
# So this script NEVER writes source-derived matched text, matched line content, or a
# matching file's path to stdout or stderr. It reports only the category and aggregate
# count. grep output is discarded; only trusted filenames from the enumerated input set
# are written to a private temporary file for counting.
#
# Usage: scripts/leak-gate.sh [ROOT]   (defaults to repo root)
# Exit 0 = clean (or no term set configured); exit 1 = at least one forbidden term found;
# exit 2 = the scan could not complete safely. Any non-zero exit is the fail-closed boundary
# documented in SECURITY.md and relied on by build.mjs / promote.mjs / timeline.mjs.

set -euo pipefail

# Tracing is disabled BEFORE the term set is sourced, and stays off. `bash -x` (or an
# inherited SHELLOPTS/BASH_XTRACEFD) would otherwise echo `++ STRONG=<protected term>` as
# the terms file is sourced — turning the gate into the disclosure. This script is
# deliberately opaque at this boundary; inspect candidate inputs separately in a trusted
# local workflow when debugging a hit.
# The umask clamp also protects every private temporary file this gate creates.
set +x
umask 077

# Scan-integrity clamp, not a workflow preference: refs/replace/* must never change what this
# gate reads. Set here too because the gate is also invoked standalone (CI, build, promote,
# timeline), where it never inherits the pre-push hook's environment.

# ── load the confidential term set (never hardcoded in this public repo) ─────
# The term set is OPTIONAL and, for an external contributor, unobtainable by design: shipping
# it would enumerate the protected identifiers. Its absence therefore must NOT disable the gate.
#
# It used to. A missing term set printed "SKIPPED" and exited 0, so on every machine without
# ~/.config/aios-nda/ the gate was decorative — while CONTRIBUTING.md instructed contributors to
# run it and expect a clean result. A contributor pushed a client prospect brief to a branch of
# this PUBLIC repo and saw green. The skip message even claimed "local write-time + pre-commit
# hooks still enforce", which is false: those hooks read this same missing file.
#
# So the gate now has TWO layers, and the always-on one is the baseline:
#   • BASELINE  — name-free shape rules, below, shipped in this repo, ALWAYS enforced.
#   • TERM SET  — the private identifier list, when available, layered on top.
# No term set now degrades to baseline-only and says so honestly, instead of to nothing.

# ── enumerate scan targets via GIT, never a filesystem walk (AIO-517) ───────
# A recursive grep descends into gitignored build trees (`src-tauri/target` is 1.6 GB /
# 35k files) and dies of resource exhaustion — a scanner that fails by NOT finishing is
# worse than one that finds nothing. Git's file list (tracked + untracked-but-not-ignored)
# is exactly the content that can ever be published, and it makes every ignored tree
# structurally invisible instead of relying on an ad-hoc exclude list that drifts.
# Non-git targets (a single file from `aios promote`, a throwaway render dir from
# `aios timeline`, the change-set dir from `aios build`) keep the walk — they hold only
# the material being gated, so there is no ignored tree to descend into.
#
# Exclusions still applied on top: VCS, binaries, LICENSE (copyright holder), vendored
# upstream skills, and deliberately-malicious scanner test fixtures.
# skill-library/ — vendored, integrity-locked official upstream skills (OGR09).
# skill-scan-fixtures/ — DELIBERATELY-malicious scanner test inputs; never shipped.
# target/ — Rust/Tauri build output; gitignored. evidence/ — gitignored UX harness output.
# .env / .env.local* / .env.keys* — local-only config and dotenvx key material, including
#   rotation and backup copies (`.env.keys.bak-<date>`). Exact-match patterns missed those,
#   so the shapes are globbed. `.env.example` is deliberately NOT skipped: it is tracked,
#   published, and must be scanned like any other shipped file.
# (docs/strategy/ was deleted from the repo entirely (PR #336) — nothing strategy-related is
#  excluded; the full docs tree is scanned like everything else.)
